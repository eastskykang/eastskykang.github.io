Check out Lukas Molnar's recent work, ["Whole-body Inverse Dynamics MPC for Legged Loco-Manipulation,"](https://lukasmolnar.github.io/wb-mpc-locoman/) to see how we address the challenge of loco-manipulation tasks. This paper introduces a Whole-Body MPC framework that unifies motion and force planning within a single control layer. The paper has been accepted to [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) for the special issue on "Advancement on MPC and Learning Algorithms for Legged Robots."
