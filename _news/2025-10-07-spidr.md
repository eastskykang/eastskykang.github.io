I'm thrilled to share that a collaborative project I was a part of, ["SPiDR: A Simple Approach for Zero-Shot Safety in Sim-to-Real Transfer"](https://yardenas.github.io/spidr/) has been accepted to [NeurIPS 2025](https://neurips.cc/). Huge congrats to [Yarden As](https://yas.pub/) for leading this excellent work!
