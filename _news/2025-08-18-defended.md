I have successfully defended my dissertation "Animal Motion Imitation For Adaptive and Lifelike Control of Legged Robots" at ETH Zurich. A huge thanks to my supervisors Stelian Coros, Marco Hutter, committee members, amazing collaborators, and peers at [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/) who made this possible. It has been an amazing journey with so many unforgettable memories and valuable lessons. I am truly grateful to everyone who has shown me tremendous support.
