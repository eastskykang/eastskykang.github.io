After an incredible journey completing my PhD, Iâ€™m starting my next chapter as a research scientist at the [RAI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/). I am excited to join the amazing team and contribute to the mission of creating the next generations of intelligent robots. Looking forward to the exciting challenges and collaborations ahead.
