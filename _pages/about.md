I am a doctoral student in computer science based in Zurich, Switzerland 🇨🇭. 
From 2019, I am a scientific assistant of the [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Prof. Stelian Coros.

The goal of my research is to create legged robots that exhibit natural and animal-like behaviors. 
Thus, my research interests are broad ranging from legged locomotion control to computational methods for motion and behavior synthesys. 

Apart from my professional bio, I am originally from Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷. 
Describing myself, I am a video game fan and a classical music lover.
