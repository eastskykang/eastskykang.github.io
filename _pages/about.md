I am a research scientist at the [Robotics and AI Institute (RAI institute)](https://rai-inst.com/) based in Zurich, Switzerland 🇨🇭. 
I completed my doctorate in computer science in 2025 at the [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Prof. Stelian Coros. My doctoral research focused on developing control algorithms that enable legged robots to move like real animals.

My ultimate goal is to create robots that exhibit lifelike, natural, and adaptive motor skills. To achieve this, my research lies at the intersection of optimal control, reinforcement learning, and data-driven character animation.

I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷, where I spent the first 25 years of my life. Outside of my research, I'm a huge fan of video games and classical music, and also enjoy animation and sci-fi movies.
